## Suggesting features or reporting bugs

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/alex-grover/neynar-next/issues/new) before making a pull request! This package aims to be easy to use, not to support every possible use case, so a discussion ahead of time will lead to the highest chance of your change being accepted.

I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner, but if I don't get back to you in a few days please feel free to ping me in the issue or PR!

### Expectations for all changes

Thanks again and happy coding!
